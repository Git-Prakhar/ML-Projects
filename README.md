# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains various machine learning projects. Each project is organized into its own folder. Below are the instructions to set up the environment and tools required to run these projects.

## Installation

To work on these projects, you will need to install Jupyter Notebook. Follow the steps below to install it:

### Using pip

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

    ```

## Usage

I will be using Jupyter Notebook for creating and running the projects in this repository. To start Jupyter Notebook, use the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```sh
jupyter notebook
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your default web browser.

## Project Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

```
Machine Learning Projects/
│
├── /Ecommerce Purchase Prediction
│   ├── Ecommerce Customers.csv (dataset)
│   ├── index.ipynb (notebook)
│   └── README.md
│
└── README.md
```

Each project folder contains its own data and notebooks directories, along with a README file specific to that project.

Feel free to explore the projects and contribute!
